Benefits of Distributional RL
   
   1.Preserving the distribution of rewards allows agents to have a robust performance
   
   2.Captures the randomness inherent to the rewards.

For the project we sought to derive a relationship between the performance, and

  1.The number of Bins in the C51 algorithm
   
  2. The number of Quantiles in the QR-DQN algorithm
  
Cart Pole v1 Environment
 
  The goal is to keep the pole perpendicular to the cart to achieve max score.
  A reward of +1 is provided for every timestep that the pole remains upright.
  
  Action - [Move left, Move Right]
  
  Maximum reward = 500
